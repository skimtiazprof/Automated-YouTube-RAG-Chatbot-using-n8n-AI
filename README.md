# Automated-YouTube-RAG-Chatbot-using-n8n-AI
I’m excited to share my latest n8n automation project — a complete workflow that turns any YouTube video URL into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for intelligent question answering! 
Here’s what it does step-by-step:
1️⃣ Scrape YouTube Transcript automatically using the video URL.
2️⃣ Generate and Save Transcript File directly to Google Drive.
3️⃣ Download Transcript File for processing.
4️⃣ Vectorize Data using Supabase Vector Store + OpenAI Embeddings.
5️⃣ Connect with RAG Chatbot powered by OpenAI Chat Model and Google Gemini for smart, contextual Q&A based on the video content.
💡 Tech Stack:
n8n (Workflow Automation)
Apify (Transcript Scraping)
OpenAI + Gemini (LLMs for intelligence)
Supabase (Vector Storage)
Google Drive (File Storage)
This setup allows you to chat with YouTube videos — ask questions, get instant insights, and explore content interactively!
